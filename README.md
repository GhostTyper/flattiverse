# Flattiverse Reference Connector

This is the Flattiverse reference connector for the websocket protocol. You can use this to derive own connectors in other (or even the C#) programming language(s). If you want to participate by creating a connector for another programming language, read [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md).

This connector is compatible to .NET 6. Currently you can't download a Connector.
