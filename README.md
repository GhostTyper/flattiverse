# Flattiverse Reference Connector

This is the Flattiverse reference connector for the websocket protocol. You can use this to derive own connectors in other (or even the C#) programming language(s). If you want to participate by creating a connector for another programming language, read [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md).

You may find API keys in this repository which most likely are outdated meanwhile. Go to [https://www.flattiverse.com](https://www.flattiverse.com), register an account and generate your own API key.

We are currently preparing this version for the next course. If you find or suspect any bugs don't hesitate to contact the devs on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3q7TvFbz).

The connector will be compatible to .NET 8 and binaries will be made available via NuGet.
